# 👋 Hey, I'm InkedQT

🎯 I'm a cybersecurity student documenting my journey through **CTF challenges**, primarily on [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) and other platforms.

---

## 🧠 What I'm Working On

- 🔐 Learning Linux privilege escalation
- 📡 Practicing real-world attack paths
- 🛠 Building a portfolio of writeups [here](https://github.com/inkedqt/ctf-writeups)

---

## 🚩 Featured Writeups

- 🧪 [HTB: Chemistry](https://github.com/inkedqt/ctf-writeups/tree/main/HTB/chemistry)  
  Remote file parsing → RCE via pymatgen, local file inclusion, and SSH key abuse

- 🛎️ [HTB: Alert](https://github.com/inkedqt/ctf-writeups/tree/main/HTB/alert)  
  Advanced Markdown XSS → Base64 exfil → LFI → Group permission privesc

- 🧱 [HTB: Lame](https://github.com/inkedqt/ctf-writeups/tree/main/HTB/lame)  
  Classic Linux box exploited via Samba usermap script (Metasploit)

- 💙 [HTB: Blue](https://github.com/inkedqt/ctf-writeups/tree/main/HTB/blue)  
  EternalBlue exploit (MS17-010) on Windows 7, gaining full SYSTEM access

- ⚙️ [HTB: Optimum](https://github.com/inkedqt/ctf-writeups/tree/main/HTB/optimum)  
  Rejetto HFS exploit + WinPEAS + local exploit suggester for SYSTEM shell
